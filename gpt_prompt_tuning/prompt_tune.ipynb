The provided video shows a human performing an action in an unrelated background (e.g., a video of a person playing tennis on a golf course). The model should classify the video as 'playing tennis' based on the action in the video and ignore the background. The model’s accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified videos. The background bias is how often the model classifies based on background instead of the action. You can test your prompt by outputting a single new line starting with 'PROMPT:'. Do not list options—the system will provide them automatically. Try to keep the prompt as short and simple as possible, but be creative. It might be reasonable to summarize the insights of previous attempts and to outline your goals before responding with a new prompt, but make sure that only the prompt starts with 'PROMPT:'. In response to the prompt, you will be told the accuracy and background bias. Then you will refine the prompt, and we will continue until I say stop. Let’s go!\"},\n",
